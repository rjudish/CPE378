help adding units when spawning in interior

toggles should only be visible if they're your faction (default state 0?)
make sure you can't interact with toggles that don't belong to you

Flipping a toggle to outside should flip other outside pointing toggles in the territory to inside?
Turn direction of toggles to match map directions (post alpha)

Territory manpower variance
Tie in ID numbers
Tie in directionality?
Reorder border creation to directions match IDs
Set images of nothing for items that are invisible (transparency, null, something)

retype trooplist and territory list to private and use getter/setters

manpower is
	A) spawn rate of a territory
	B) how many men are at a border - use borderTroopCount?
	C) how many men are in a "troop"?
